# Details

Currently nothing more than a gameplay prototype. Contains only the song "Oh Susanna".

Project was to be renamed to Rhythm Rivals. Yet, the game icon does not convert well. A pixelated `TH` ![TH logo](https://github.com/Feddas/RhythmRivals/blob/efde2fd0dd62c8fdcae799cf6f4ff0a30219c4a5/Assets/Media/Icons/Logo.png?raw=true) looks much better than `RR`![RR logo](Assets/Media/Icons/Logo.png) .

# Credits
